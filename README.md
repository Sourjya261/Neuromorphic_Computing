Basic theory for the simulation of spiking neuron model

Document 29_1
for small tau the neuron acts as a coincidence detector. First spike raises the membrane potential of the neuron as a result of which it pushes the second spike over the threshold -> and the neuron fires a spike.
but if we increase the time duration between the input spikes the membrane potential never reaches the threshold
